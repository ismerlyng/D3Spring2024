## Scatterplot HW 1
**February 20, 2024**

I accessed the x- and y-values of the sub-arrays in the variable ***data*** array to plot the circles in the scatterplot below. Then, I proceeded to style the visualization with green colors, in addition to adjusting the font and positioning of the text. The data has no known external source - it is an array created for this homework's purposes.
