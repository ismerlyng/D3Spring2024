## Adding Data Update to Line Chart - HW 4
**April 2, 2024**

I added a third salary to my visualization of ACS, or Administration for Children's Services, payroll data (data downloaded from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/about_data). Similarly to HW 3, I calculated the average pay of the third position - that of a Program Evaluator. This position had an average salary situated between that of a caseworker's and of a director's. 

This was the line chart prior to the data update:

This was the line chart after the data update (differences are buttons and a title):
