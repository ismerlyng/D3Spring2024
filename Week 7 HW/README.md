## Creating a Multi-Line Chart - HW 3
**March 19, 2024**

My multi-line chart visualizes NYC agency employee payroll data from the Administration for Children's Services (data downloaded from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/about_data). I was interested in seeing the difference between a caseworker's salary and that of a director's (in this case, an Administrative Director of Social Services), and how their salaries have changed over time. Before using d3, I calculated the average base pay of the two positions from 2014 to 2023. 

The green line represents the average director's salary. The blue line represents the average caseworker's salary.
